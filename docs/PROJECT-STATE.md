# Project state

Role: Compact handoff of the project's current truth.
Read when: At the start of every nontrivial task.
Authoritative for: Current checkpoint, immediate focus, implemented functionality, and active blockers.
Not authoritative for: Durable decisions, future plans, detailed contracts, or Git HEAD/status.

## Current checkpoint

R3 is complete. The project version is `0.0.0.0006`; its semantics and accepted checkpoint history are owned by [`VERSIONING.md`](VERSIONING.md).

The retained R0 probe remains experimental evidence under `experiments/Fovium.RenderProbe`. Production code is the single `Fovium` assembly and does not depend on the experiment. Local Windows acceptance used one `RenderScaling = 1.00` display; no GitHub-hosted CI or Linux/macOS runtime result is claimed by this stage.

## Current focus

R4 — Peek 100% / Blink Compare photographer-inspection interactions.

## Implemented application functionality

- Runnable zero-UI Avalonia desktop viewer with Black, Neutral, Ambient, and Ambient + Matte Stage modes.
- JPEG/PNG content probing and decode with EXIF orientation.
- Fit, physical-pixel 100%, cursor-anchored wheel zoom, pan, and view-state preservation.
- Same-directory single-file activation and ordered explicit multi-file activation.
- Natural filename ordering, failure skipping, adjacent preload, latest-wins publication, and a byte-bounded cache.
- Fullscreen, cursor auto-hide, `Ctrl+O`, and a basic temporary context menu.
- English/Russian runtime localization foundation with English fallback.
- Persistent image-change view policy: Keep current scale by default, or Fit each image.
- Minimal dark Settings window with Viewing and About, schema-versioned JSON autosave, and malformed-file fallback.
- Persisted Stage preference with synchronized Settings and context-menu surfaces.
- Bounded asynchronous Ambient preparation from the oriented decoded photograph, adjacent preparation, byte-accounted cache ownership, and Black failure fallback.
- Traversal-excluded local imaging corpus policy plus hardened async session shutdown/cache release.

Language/theme selection, metadata UI, Peek/Blink, broad codecs, file associations/thumbnails, and full monitor-aware ICC are not implemented.

## Active blockers

- Avalonia's direct-Skia lease used by the accepted initial renderer is explicitly unstable and must remain isolated.
- Physical-pixel 100% is validated by pure tests at 1.00/1.25/1.50/2.00, but production runtime evidence exists only at `RenderScaling = 1.00`; per-monitor transitions still need real hardware coverage.
- The monitor-aware color pipeline and raw embedded-profile extraction boundary have not been selected.
- Broader codec support and a huge/tiled-image strategy remain unselected.
- GitHub Actions portability is configured but cannot be claimed as passing until the workflow runs remotely.

Open technical risks are tracked in [`KNOWN-PROBLEMS.md`](KNOWN-PROBLEMS.md). Directional stages are in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md). Git remains the authority for branch, HEAD, and worktree status.
